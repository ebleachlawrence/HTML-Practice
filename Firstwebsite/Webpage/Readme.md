# My first webpage
This is my first attempt at creating a html and CSS webpage. I decided to do it on some of my favourite albums because I could talk about music for hours. 

## Planning
I began by sketching out how I wanted it to look and then subsequently changed my mind every time I worked on the project.

## Building
I used free tutorials on W3 schools and freecodeacademy to build the basic structure and try implement some CSS. I struggled most with the javascript elements.
